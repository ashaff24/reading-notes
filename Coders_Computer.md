## The Terminal
AKA: The Command Line Interface (CLI)
Basically does the same thing as File Explorer but in a different visual presentation
When you use File Explorer, terminal tasks are actually running behind the scenes

### Examples of commands in Terminal:
- ls = lists all files/folders in directory
- mkdir = make directory
- cd = change directory
- cd .. = go back one directory
- touch = create new file
