# Operators and Loops

### Operators
- **Comparison operator**
    Can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. The result will be true/false
    - `==` is equal to
    - `===` is strict equal to
    - `!=` is not equal to
    - `!==` is strict not equal to
    "strict" compares value AND data type. Suggested to use this
    - `>` greater than
    - `<` less than
    - `>=` greater than or equal to
    - `<=` less than or equal to
 - **Logical operators**
    Compare the resutls of more than one comparison operator
    - `&&` logical and - both have to be true to return true
    - `||` logical or - both have to be false to return false
    - `!` logical not - reverses the state of an expression

### Loops
- Check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run
    - **For loop** - If you need to run a code a specific number of times
    - **While loop** - If you do not know how many times the code should run
    - **Do while loop** - Similar to while loop, but will always run the statments inside the curly braces at least once, even if condition returns false
