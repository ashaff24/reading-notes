# Amanda's Reading Note's Page

Hi, my name is Amanda. I have worked in the animal care world for 20 years and am looking to change jobs. While I am passionate about animals, my body and my mind are telling me I need a career shift and I am excited to learn something new. 

I have four-legged children: two dogs, a cat, and a tortoise.

### What is *Growth Mindset*?

Growth mindset is a more flexible way of thinking than a fixed mindset. This suggests that intelligence, knowledge, talent, and many other characteristics can be improved by hard work and dedication. In this kind of mindset, there is no ability that you "aren't born with." You just have to work hard to improve whatever abilities that might be your focus at any given time. A few ways that I can stay in the growth mindset are to:

- Learn from criticism as I move forward on this coding journey
- Embrace each challenge that presents itself and let it encourage me
- Push through obstacles instead of telling myself I am not smart enough to figure it out.

In the words of Steve Haffenden:

> We live in a society where the instant gratification monkey sits on everyoneâ€™s shoulder. But the pleasures that result from determination and hard work far outweigh anything that devilish chimp has to offer.
