## HTML & Wireframe

- Foundation
- Using structure provided made it easier
- Worked first time
- Validating and awesome
- Wireframe and labels helped create the structure
- Wireframe is the direction of where we are going


- Tried to link pages and worked great

<body> - everything inside of the body will be visible on the rendered webpage. Where the content of our page goes.

<!DOCTYPE html> - tells the browser what it is reading and to expect HTML

<head> - Title, link css, link js, meta data, sizing data, set language. Does not directly display on our webpage (with the exception of the title). Will affect certain results on our page

3 areas in the body?
- header
- main
- footer

**Semantic html**: code that divides your page up into different parts. Want them to make sense. Think of them as containers that hold data. If I want to do something that affects everything in the main container, I can use css for the main container. Or I can target another more specific container. 

<div> vs <section> - section makes more sense. We try to stay away from <div> now because there are other containers that do the same thing but are more descriptive.
