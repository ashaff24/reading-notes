# JS Review

### What is a variable?
- A place to store a piece of information

- `var userName = prompt('What is your name?);`

- When you see "var" - you are declaring the username
assigning it to the return what is your name
Now, whenever JS sees userName, it will replace it with whatever people type in for userName

- **string** = 'word' or "word" can use single or double, just have to be consistent

- **number** = 45, 23, 11, etc

    - '45' does not equal 45

    - `'45' == 45` this means equals (comparing value) 
        - this would be true
    - `'45' === 45` this means strict equals (comparing value and data type)
        - this would be false
    - best practice is to use the `===`

- **Boolean**
    - true or false

- Arrays and objects are a thing. Will learn about this in 201.

- Can use JavaScript to protect against user error (i.e. capitals, misspelling, etc)
