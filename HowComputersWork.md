# How Computers Work

All computers do the following 4 things:
    - Take input
        - Stuff we do that makes computer do stuff
    - Store info
        - Info stored in memory
    - Process it
        - Processor takes input from memory and manipulates it using algorithm (series of commands), then sends back to memory. Does this over and over again until processed info is ready to be output
    - Output results
         - Depends on what computer is designed to do

This is all done via **binary code**, using 1s and 0s
    - Nobody really uses binary code directly anymore
    - Plays a big role in how computers work on the inside
    - Inside the computer are electric wires and circuits that carry all of the info in a computer
    - With 1s and 0s, we can represent anything with two options. This is called a **bit** and it is the smallest piece of info a computer can have
    - More wires can store more numbers
    - Everything is represented in 1s and 0s, including numbers, text, images and sound

Circuits work to process all of the information
    - Responsible for processing the inputs for the correct output
    - Lots of little circuits under the hood of the computer
    - The CPU (central processing unit) tells the computer which circuits to use to process the requested information for the appropriate output
    - Smaller computers are faster than the older, larger computers, because the smaller it is, the less distance electrical circuit has to go

Hardware and software
    - Hardware - chips, circuits, wires, etc
    - Software - computer programs, code
    - CPU - master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer
    - Binary code - most basic form of software and controls all the hardware of the computer
    - Operating system - the master program that manages how software uses the hardware on the computer
