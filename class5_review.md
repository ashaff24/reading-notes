# Review of CSS

- Using borders around everything helped visualize. Can tell what is inline vs. what is block
    - Wildcard to put borders around everything
    - Include border in size of box: border-box
- GUI color picker (RGB codes)
- Cool website to pick colors
    - look at color pallets
    - look at color gradients
    - Google-Fu. Get strong
-Fixed/relative position
    - if fixed: when you scroll, it is a fixed position
- Flexbox and grid coming in 201/301
- CSS is a time suck. Limit yourself
