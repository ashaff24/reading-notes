# Programming with JavaScript

Javascript can be used to make webpages more interactive
    - Access content
    - Modify content
    - Program rules
    - React to events

**Script**
    - A series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal
    - Made up of instructions a computer can follow step by step
    - A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user intereacts with the web page
    - Scripts can run different sections of the coee in response to the situation around them
    - **Writing a script**
        - State your goal, then list the tasks needed to complete the goal
        - Program must give the computer enough detail to perform the task as if every time were the first time
        - Define the goal, design the script, code each step
        - Use flowcharts to work out how the tasks fit together

**Expressions**
    - Results in a single value
        - Expressions that just assign a value to a variable
        - Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value
    - Rely on **operators** which allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values
        - **Assignment operators** - Assign a value to a variable
        - **Arithmetic operators** - Perform basic math
            - Order of execution - multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction. If you want something to come first, put the equation in parenthases.
        - **String operators** - Combine two strings
            - Use the + symbol
            - **Concatenation** - join two or more strings to create a single value
            - When you place quotes around a number, it is a string
            - If you try to use anything other than +, you will get NaN (not a number)
            - Make sure to add space when combining strings so all the words don't just mush together
        - **Comparison operators** - Compare two values and return true/false
        - **Logical operators** - Combine expressions and return true/false

**Functions**
    - Let you group a series of statements together to perofmr a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function instead of repeating the same set of statments.
    - The steps needed to perform the function are packaged in a code block which is between `{}`
    - **Parameters** - pieces of information passed to a function
    - **Return value** - Response from a function
    - **Function declaration** - give it a name and then write the statement to achieve its task inside the curly braces
    - **Calling a function** - Execute all of the statements between the curly braces with just one line of code
